# ACR35
Android + iOS ***Apache Cordova*** demo for the ACR35 NFC reader

## What does this do? / Who is this for?

This project contains a basic demo application that explains how to use the ACR35 reader to read the UID of NFC tags, using the cross-platform mobile development framework Apache Cordova. It uses the ACR35 SDK that was produced by Advanced Card Systems (ACS). In addition, on Android only, the application checks two connection indicators: device media volume (must be set to 100% for operation) and device audio socket plugged-in status.

***Current functionality:***

* Set reader to poll for nearby NFC tags **every second**
* Upon tag read, send its UID to the Cordova application and display in a toast
* Send reader into sleep mode (saves battery)
* Connection status checking (based on a timeout for command response)
* (Android only) Additional connection status checking based on device media volume and device audio socket plugged-in status

This project is aimed towards anyone who is interested in using the ACR35 reader with NFC-less Android and iOS devices, and would like to quickly get the SDK up and running. **In particular, this will save you going through the arduous process of writing a Cordova plugin that works with the reader**. The advantage of using a framework like Cordova is that native code can mostly be replaced by JavaScript, which works the same across most devices. This can greatly accelerate the process of developing an application for multiple mobile operating systems.

### What if I don't want to use Apache Cordova?

The native code written for the plugin can be easily transferred into a fully native application. Simply replace all usage of Cordova-specific code and paste into your project.

### Why does [ACR35 development](http://flomio.com/forums/forum/ask-the-flomies/) link to 'Flomio'?

Taken from the [Flomio forums](http://flomio.com/forums/topic/difference-between-acr35-and-flojack/):
> The FloJack (v2) and the ACR35 are the exact same hardware. They are both manufactured by Advanced Card Systems, a company specialized in smart card readers that weâ€™ve been partners with for several years now.

> The FloJack v1 was developed internally at Flomio for a Kickstarter campaign in 2012. After dealing with issues supporting the many mobile operating systems we abandoned this project for the FloBLE (now production ready). In June of 2014 we were approached by Advanced Card Systems to carry their newest reader the ACR35. We agreed to rebrand it FloJack with the understanding that we would build out the software stack similar to what we offered with the FloJack v1. This included connect/disconnect management, audio routed alerts, NDEF parsing, read/write data blocks, authentication routines, etc. These features are crucial to allowing the reader to perform plug and play very much like an Android NFC enabled phone would.

Essentially, Flomio are very helpful in providing support for the ACR35 reader but, at least in name, they are not linked to the 'unbranded' **ACR35 reader**.

### What devices are compatible with the ACR35 reader?

Please see [this document](http://www.acs.com.hk/download-manual/6498/ACR3x-Supported-Mobile-Devices-1.05.pdf).

## Brief technical explanation

The host mobile device communicates with the ACR35 reader through the 3.5mm audio socket. Audio signals are sent through the input jack to be received and interpreted by the reader. APDU commands are sent to the reader, which perform different functions. To read the UID of a ***Mifare*** NFC tag, the following APDU command should be sent:
```
0xFF 0xCA 0x00 0x00 0x00
```

***NOTE: if you are not using Mifare NFC tags and this APDU command does not work for you, please refer to this [forum post](http://flomio.com/forums/topic/list-of-apdu-codes/) and the technical documentation in the [ACR35 SDK](http://www.acs.com.hk/download-driver-unified/6934/ACR3x-EVK-Android-1.00.zip) to find the correct APDU command. Then, edit `acr35/plugin/src/android/acr35.java` and `acr35/plugin/src/ios/UIDReader.m` to update the `apdu` variable. After this, remove the plugin and re-add it as per the usage example below.***

When the `read` function of the Cordova plugin is called, a new polling thread is started which sends out this APDU command every second. Within the native code, a callback is assigned for when a response to the command comes through from the reader. This response can then be processed, including conversion from a byte array to a string. Read the [ACR35 SDK](http://www.acs.com.hk/download-driver-unified/6934/ACR3x-EVK-Android-1.00.zip) documentation for details of the different possible response codes that are not UIDs.

## Plugin

### Methods

* `acr35.read`
* `acr35.sleep`

### Details

* `acr35.read(cardType, successCallback, failureCallback)`
  <br> Starts a polling thread where the reader sends out the APDU command for reading tag UIDs every second. In this loop, the connection status of the reader is automatically periodically checked
    * **cardType**: a string containing the card type to be read (global variable `cardType` is set to '143' - this is the default in the demo application provided by ACS). Card types provided in the [ACR35 SDK](http://www.acs.com.hk/download-driver-unified/6934/ACR3x-EVK-Android-1.00.zip) documentation:
      <br> ![Card types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stuart-xyz/acr35/master/card_types.png "Card types")
    * **successCallback(message)**: JavaScript function to be called when the reader sends feedback. Possible messages:
        * *A string containing the UID of a tag that has been read*
        * "disconnected": cannot communicate with the reader (3 second timeout has been reached with no response to read UID APDU command)
        * (Android only) "low_volume": the device media volume is less than 100%
        * (Android only) "unplugged": the reader is unplugged from the audio socket
        * (iOS only) "initialised": placeholder message that is sent when the reader has been initialised
    * **failureCallback()**: JavaScript function to be called when an internal application error occurs while polling
* `acr35.sleep(successCallback, failureCallback)`
  <br> Stops the polling thread and then sends the reader to sleep
    * **successCallback()**: called when the sleep method executed successfully
    * **failureCallback()**: called when an internal application error occurred

### Generate documentation

To generate documentation for Android and iOS code, execute `acr35/plugin/src/android/generate_docs.sh` or `acr35/plugin/src/ios/generate_docs.sh`. This will output html documentation to `docs`. Android source code has been documented with *JavaDoc* and iOS source code with *Doxygen*.

## Quirks

For the ACR35 reader to function correctly, it must be put to sleep, re-woken and reset again before starting the polling thread (this has been implemented in the native plugin code). In general, the reader can be unstable unless given sufficient time in between successive operations.

When sending the APDU command for reading a UID, the reader will respond with either `90 00` or another response starting with `90 00` when there is no nearby card. In the demo Cordova application, the JavaScript `successCallback` filters out responses like this so that processing only occurs when a card is actually nearby. Read the [ACR35 SDK](http://www.acs.com.hk/download-driver-unified/6934/ACR3x-EVK-Android-1.00.zip) documentation for details of the different possible response codes (that are not UIDs).

## TODO

* **iOS**: Add additional connection status checking based on device media volume and device audio socket plugged-in status
* Integrate more functionality from the ACR35 SDK into the Cordova plugin (more than just UID reading)
